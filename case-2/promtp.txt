Create a complete Qiskit program that demonstrates the violation of Bell inequalities.

Requirements:
- Use Version 1.0 of Qiskit
- Include `pip` installation commands for any non-standard Python packages required (e.g., Qiskit).
- The program should:
  - Build and visualize the quantum circuits used.
  - Use a simulator to run the circuits.
  - Collect and plot the results to illustrate the violation of Bell inequalities.

Ensure the code is self-contained and executable as-is in a standard Python environment.
