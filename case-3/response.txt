To demonstrate the violation of Bell inequalities using Qiskit, you can create a quantum program that simulates the Bell test using the CHSH (Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt) inequality. This involves setting up a quantum circuit that creates an entangled state, performing measurements in different bases, and analyzing the results to show the violation.

Below is a complete Qiskit program that accomplishes this task. It includes the necessary package installations, circuit creation, simulation, and result analysis.

```python
# Installation commands for Qiskit
# You can run these lines in a Jupyter notebook or a Python script to install the required packages.
!pip install qiskit matplotlib

import numpy as np
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a function to create a Bell state circuit
def create_bell_state():
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    circuit.h(0)          # Apply Hadamard gate to the first qubit
    circuit.cx(0, 1)      # Apply CNOT gate with the first qubit as control and the second as target
    return circuit

# Define a function to add measurement to the circuit in different bases
def add_measurement(circuit, angle_a, angle_b):
    # Rotate qubit 0 by angle_a before measurement
    circuit.ry(2 * angle_a, 0)
    # Rotate qubit 1 by angle_b before measurement
    circuit.ry(2 * angle_b, 1)
    # Measure both qubits
    circuit.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
    return circuit

# Define angles for CHSH inequality
angles = {
    'a': 0,
    'a_prime': np.pi / 4,
    'b': np.pi / 8,
    'b_prime': -np.pi / 8
}

# Create and visualize circuits for each measurement setting
circuits = {}
for setting in [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b_prime'), ('a_prime', 'b'), ('a_prime', 'b_prime')]:
    circuit = create_bell_state()
    circuit = add_measurement(circuit, angles[setting[0]], angles[setting[1]])
    circuits[setting] = circuit

# Visualize the circuits
for setting, circuit in circuits.items():
    print(f"Circuit for setting {setting}:")
    print(circuit.draw())

# Use Aer simulator
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

# Function to execute the circuit and get the result
def run_circuit(circuit):
    job = execute(circuit, backend, shots=1024)
    result = job.result()
    counts = result.get_counts(circuit)
    return counts

# Run each circuit and collect results
results = {setting: run_circuit(circuit) for setting, circuit in circuits.items()}

# Plot the results
for setting, counts in results.items():
    print(f"Results for setting {setting}:")
    plot_histogram(counts)
    plt.show()

# Calculate correlation for each setting
def correlation(counts):
    total = sum(counts.values())
    correl = 0
    for outcome, count in counts.items():
        # Convert outcome string to individual bits and calculate parity
        parity = (1 if outcome.count('1') % 2 == 0 else -1)
        correl += parity * count / total
    return correl

correlations = {setting: correlation(counts) for setting, counts in results.items()}

# Calculate the CHSH parameter
S = correlations[('a', 'b')] - correlations[('a', 'b_prime')] + correlations[('a_prime', 'b')] + correlations[('a_prime', 'b_prime')]

print(f"CHSH parameter S: {S}")

# The CHSH inequality is violated if |S| > 2
if abs(S) > 2:
    print("Bell inequality violated!")
else:
    print("Bell inequality not violated.")
```

### Explanation

- **Circuit Construction**: The Bell state is created using a Hadamard gate followed by a CNOT gate. This sets up a maximally entangled state.
- **Measurement Angles**: The measurement angles are chosen to demonstrate the CHSH inequality violation.
- **Simulation**: The circuits are run on a local simulator (`qasm_simulator`), and the results are collected.
- **Analysis**: The correlation for each measurement setting is computed, and the CHSH parameter \( S \) is calculated. If \( |S| > 2 \), the Bell inequality is violated, which demonstrates quantum entanglement.
